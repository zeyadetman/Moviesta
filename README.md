## First Things First

The app uses Google Firebase to handle Sign in, Sign up and Database, so if you want to try this app on your machine, go to Google Firebase and create a new file in this path `/src/firebase/base.js` and fill it with data as in this file `/src/firebase/examplebase.js`. If you faced any troubles, contact me.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
